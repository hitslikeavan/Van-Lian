👋 Hi, I’m Van

I’m an IT Analyst building toward System Administration and Cloud Engineering, with hands-on experience supporting enterprise environments across nearly 200 healthcare facilities. My background includes Windows systems administration, Active Directory and Microsoft Entra ID management, networking fundamentals (TCP/IP, DNS, DHCP, VLANs), and troubleshooting infrastructure issues in high-availability environments.

I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Information Technology and have foundational knowledge of Java and object-oriented programming, which strengthens my analytical and systems-thinking approach. I’m currently deepening my expertise in Linux, AWS, and automation to bridge traditional infrastructure with modern cloud architectures.

🔧 Current Focus

AWS architecture and core services

Infrastructure as Code (Terraform / CloudFormation)

Python & Bash for automation

Networking and cloud security fundamentals

🎯 Career Direction

Transitioning into System Administration and Cloud Engineering roles where I can design, automate, and support scalable, resilient infrastructure.
